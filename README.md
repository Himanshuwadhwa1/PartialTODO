## Todo App

Very Basic Application
This project is just for learning purpose and is partially completed but not optimized
This projects contains a single ToDo Application
It has following features -

- Anyone can create a TODO
- Anyone can see their existing TODOs
- Anyone can mark a TODO as done

Express - for back-end
Zod - for input validation
Mongoose - for Mongo connection
MongoDB as Database

React - for Front-end
2 Components-
- Create todo
- render todo

Things to fix-
- Infinite requests to get todos because of using fetch not useEffect hook
- Not yet implemented update todo

To run this first change mongoDB connection url to your own connection url
Then try reading comment 

After changing directories run npm i to install dependencies


Run npm run dev to start frontend in specific directory
Run node index.js to start backend in specific directory
